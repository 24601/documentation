Starting with version 1.10.0 we've released our CLI utility, with it, most of the common tasks you'd have to run with your self-hosted version of OpenReplay can be done with a simple command
.


## Installing the CLI tool

By default, with every self-hosted version of OpenReplay, you'll have access to our CLI tool.

## Using the CLI tool

The CLI tool has the following syntax:

```bash 
openreplay [command] <service>
```

The list of commands available is:

- `-h or --help`: This command will display the list of commands and services available.
- `-s or --status`: If you want to know what's the status of the deployed sevices ,this command will give tell you everything you need to know.
- `-u or --upgrade`: Used to upgrade your installation to the latest version available.
- `-U or --deprecated-upgrade /path/to/old_vars.yaml`: ????
- `-r or --restart`: Allows you to restart all services . By doing so, you can fix unresponsive services.
- `-R or --Reload`: Reloads the configuration of a service, so use it only when you change something.
- `-p or --install-packages`: It updates all 3rd party dependencies (like `kubectl`, `helm`, etc).
- `-l or --logs SERVICE`: Shows the logs from one particular service.

The list of all services you'll have access to is:


- alerts
- assets
- assist
- chalice
- db
- ender
- frontend
- heuristics
- http
- integrations
- ngix-controller
- peers
- sink
- sourcemapreader
- storage

## Example
To use the OpenReplay CLI to get the status of your deploy, you can use the following command:

```bash 
openreplay -s 
```

The resul would be something similar to this:
