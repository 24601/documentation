Upgrading your OpenReplay deployment to the latest version requires updating both your backend (instance) and tracker.

## Upgrade Backend

1. Copy/backup the current openreplay folder to `_version-number` like below:
   
  ```bash 
  mv openreplay openreplay_v1.9.0
  ```

2. Update the CLI:
   
  ```bash
  # Update kubernetes deprecated apis
  helm plugin install https://github.com/helm/helm-mapkubeapis
  helm mapkubeapis -n app openreplay
	
	# Download the latest CLI
	sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openreplay/openreplay/main/scripts/helmcharts/openreplay-cli -O /bin/openreplay ; sudo chmod +x /bin/openreplay
  ```

3. Upgrade OpenReplay:

  ```bash
	# Make sure the path to your old vars.yaml is correct
	openreplay --deprecated-upgrade ~/openreplay_v1.9.0/scripts/helmcharts/vars.yaml
  ```

> Note: Your updated OpenReplay config file will be stored in `/var/lib/openreplay/var.yaml`.

## Upgrade Tracker

Ensure your tracker (and tracker-assist plugin if you do use the Assist plugin) is compatible with the new backend version by checking the below compatibility table:

| Backend Version | Minimum Tracker Version | Minimum Assist Version (NPM) |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1.10.0 | 5.0.0 | 5.0.0 |
| 1.9.0 | 4.1.9 | 4.1.3 |
| 1.8.1 | 4.1.4 | 4.1.1 |
| 1.8.0 | 4.0.1 | 4.0.1 |
| 1.7.0 | 3.5.15 | 3.5.14 |
| 1.6.0 | 3.5.12 | 3.5.11 |
| 1.5.4 | 3.5.4 | 3.5.7 |
| 1.5.3 | 3.5.3 | 3.5.5 |
