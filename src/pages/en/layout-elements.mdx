:::caution[Using with pnpm]
Due to upstream issues inside Prettier, the plugin will not be automatically detected when using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). In order to make it find the plugin, the following parameter needs to be added when running Prettier:

```shell
prettier --write --plugin-search-dir=. .
```

Additional settings are also required when using Prettier inside VS Code. See the plugin's README for more information.
