This method can be used to report a "[technical event](/installation/custom-events)", otherwise known as an "issue".
These issues can be used to report extra information regarding a problem that the tracker can't pick up by default. A good example of this would be the user trying to pay for a purchase 
on our e-commerce site and receving an error from the payment gateway. While the tracker could record the payload with the error, it would not identify it as a problem. This method lets you flag 
this behavior as an issue for further filtering of sessions.

For an example of how to use this method, checkout this detailed tutorial about [tracking custom events](/tutorials/custom-events).

## Signature
```js
issue(key: string, payload?: any): void
```

## Parameters

- `key: string`: The name of the key where the data of the event will be saved. You can use this value in the filter fields inside the OpenReplay platform.
- `payload: any`: The data related to the tracked event. You can save any serializable object here.

## Return value
This method does not return any value, you'll be able to see the information tracked inside the OpenReplay platform.
