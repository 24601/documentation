import Aside from '../../components/Aside.astro'

The OpenReplay JavaScript SDK will give you all you need to start tracking your user's sessions and customize the data you track, and how you track it.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @openreplay/tracker
```

## Initialization

Initialize the package from your codebase entry point and start the tracker. 
You must set the `projectKey` option in the constructor. You can get this value from your OpenReplay dashboard under 'Preferences > Projects'.

<Aside type="tip">
  Note that if you have multiple projects, you need to be careful which project key you choose.
</Aside>


If your website is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** use the below code:

```js
import OpenReplay from '@openreplay/tracker';
//...
const tracker = new OpenReplay({
  projectKey: PROJECT_KEY
});
tracker.start(); //  returns a promise with session info (sessionID, sessionHash, userUUID)
```

Otherwise, if your web app is **Server-Side-Rendered (SSR)** (i.e. NextJS, NuxtJS) use the below snippet. Ensure `tracker.start()` is called once the app is started (in `useEffect` or `componentDidMount`).

```js
import OpenReplay from '@openreplay/tracker/cjs';
//...
const tracker = new OpenReplay({
      projectKey: PROJECT_KEY,
});
//...
function MyApp() {
  useEffect(() => { // use componentDidMount in case of React Class Component
    tracker.start(); //  returns a promise with session info (sessionID, sessionHash, userUUID)
  }, [])
}
```

If you're using a particular web framework, check out our [Tracker Setup section](/using-or) to know how to get started.
